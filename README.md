# Python-currency-convertor
The program carries out straightforward currency conversion between USD, INR, EUR, and GBP for fixed exchange rates. It maintains a dictionary of the rates and has a converting function that first takes an amount and converts it to USD and then converts the amount from USD to the desired currency type. 
OBJECTIVE-
 • To create an interactive Currency Convertor using Python
 • To implement input/output operations
 • To use control structures (functions and conditions)
 • To apply strings, dictionaries, and the random module
 • To calculate the amount.

KEYFEATURE-
Converts between four major currencies
Predefined exchange rates stored in a dictionary
Basic validity check for currency codes
Beginner-friendly and easy to run
The program asks the user for an amount, a source currency, and a target currency.
It converts the input amount to USD, then converts that USD value to the target currency.
If an invalid currency code is entered, it prints an error message.

ALGORITHM SUMMARY-
1.Start the program 
2. Store exchange rates in a dictionary
3.Define a function convert with required parameters
4.Take input of the amount to be converted from user. 
5. Take input of the source currency code and target currency code.
6. Check if the currencies exist in dictionary.
7. First convert the source amount to USD then to target currency.
8. Display the converted amount.
9. If currency code is wrong, show error message.
10. Stop

PROGRAMMING CONCEPT USED-
Built-in functions:
print()
